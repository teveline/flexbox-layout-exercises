/* use flexbox numbers, ex."flex: 2" to size the boxes
rather than px or % to size each of the boxes.

Your strategy is to continuously break each section
down into smaller sections. Do not start from the column
on the left because it is the hardest one. It has a 
tricky layout. The second column is probably the easiest.
